## Rules
I've created a set of rules to prevent myself from switching away from projects too often.
1. `Currently working on` may only contain up to 5 projects at once
2. Projects may only leave `Currently working on` once they are feature complete
3. I get 2 free removal "points" a year that will allow me to override rule #2
   
   This is to make it so that I can still get rid of projects that I'm just not having fun doing

## Currently working on
+ ARA2D
+ STAL

## Other ideas
Just a list of other ideas that I have, but am not currently working on
+ Dark Souls Text Adventure

## Removals
As stated in rule #3, I get 2 free renewals a year. This is a list of items that have been removed in the past and why
