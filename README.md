## Rules
This set of rules exists to prevent myself from switching away from projects too often.
1. `Currently working on` may only contain up to 3 projects at once
2. Projects may only leave `Currently working on` once they are feature complete
3. I get 2 free removals a year that will allow me to override rule #2
   
   This is to make it so that I can still get rid of projects that I'm just not having fun doing

## Currently working on
Project | Description
----- | -----
[ARA2D](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/ARA2D) | A game about creating and managing a factory by programming robots
[STAL](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/STAL) | A (somewhat) functional programming language to be used for creating text adventures. The language would allow functions to be written that would tie into a backend in C#
Empty | 

## Feature Complete
These ideas are considered feature complete and thus could be removed from the `Currently working on` list

| Project | Description
| ----- | -----
| [Does It Have A Five](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/DoesItHaveAFive) | A website that tells the user if the current temperature has a five in it. Could definitely use some polish, but techinically feature complete
| [TaxVisualizer](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/TaxVisualizer) | A quick and dirty graph for visualizing the different Tax brackets, and comparing single vs married. Once again, could definitely use polish, but technically feature complete
    

## Other ideas
Just a list of other ideas that I have, but am not currently working on
Listed in order of interest to me

| Project | Description |
| -----   | ----- |
[Dark Souls Text Adventure](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/DarkSouls) | A reimagining of Dark Souls as a text adventure. I lack the writing skills to do this effectively for now
[Aetherium/Daedalus](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/Aetherium) | A 2D naval spaceship fighting game. This is actually the idea that got me into game dev, just never got around to fleshing this out
[Budgeter](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/Budgeter) | A website that will allow me to create and manage my budget by categorizing transactions
[Stargate Strategy Game](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/Stargate-Warfare) | A game heavily inspired by the Stargate franchise that would take place in the alternate reality where the SGC was destroyed by the Goauld. The player would have to settle on a new planet and rebuild human civilization to build an army and strike back. I have several conflicting directions I want to take this, so this is shelved for now
Portfolio Website | A website to show off all of my projects
Wire Generator | Generates wires that cross but don't run against one another. Solves using backtracking and random choices. I made this a couple years ago in processing, but I want to port to something else. Would make a neat screen saver
Lazarus | A story and world that I started writing and fleshing out around 2017. Very intriguing to me but I'm not sure where I can go with it
Inf2D | A Unity Asset that would provide the tools necessary to make an infinite procedurally generated top-down 2D world
GitHub contribution art | A bot that would automatically make commits to a dedicated GitHub account in order to make art in the contribution graph
Hamburgers in Space 2 | Hamburgers in Space, but better
[Conduits](https://github.com/SpencasaurusRex/Conduits) | A Cellular automota type game somewhat based on Von Neumann's Cellular Automata. The player would have have to manage circuits so that a given output condition is met. I was excited about this for a while, but during implementation I found that the problem wasn't well defined


## Removals
As stated in rule #3, I get 2 free removals a year. This is a list of items that have been removed in the past and why

##### 2019
